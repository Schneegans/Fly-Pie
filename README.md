> [!NOTE]
> I am currently working on a follow-up project called [🥧 Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando). I will continue to maintain Fly-Pie until Kando is ready for daily use. If you want to learn more, feel free to visit my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/schneegans)!

> The code in the `main` branch is for GNOME Shell 45+. For older GNOME versions, please use the `gnome-3.36-44` branch.

**Fly-Pie** is an extension for GNOME Shell which lets you open _marking menus_ via keyboard shortcuts.
You can use it to launch applications, simulate hotkeys, open URLs and much more.

After the installation, you can open the example menu by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>.
Once you opened a marking menu, you can seamlessly transition between three alternative selection modes:

<a href="https://youtu.be/BGXtckqhEIk"><img align="right" width="350px" src ="docs/pics/player6.jpg" /></a>

- **Point-and-Click:** Select items by clicking on them or anywhere in the corresponding wedges.
- **Marking-Mode:** Select items by drawing gestures. To do this, click anywhere and drag your mouse. Pausing or making a turn selects the currently dragged item.
- **Turbo-Mode:** You can also "draw" gestures while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, or <kbd>Alt</kbd> _without having to press your mouse button_! This is especially useful when you opened the menu with a shortcut involving such a modifier.

# :heart: Will you love Fly-Pie?

Fly-Pie is designed for you **if you have one hand at the mouse** most of the time.
It is _not_ designed to be used with a keyboard only; there are other
applications which work better in this case (for example [kupfer](https://github.com/kupferlauncher/kupfer)).
Fly-Pie also works nicely with **touch input**.
