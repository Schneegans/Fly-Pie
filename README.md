**Fly-Pie**, the attractive marking menu for GNOME Shell.

Launch applications, simulate hotkeys, open URLs and much more. \
The continuous learning curve lets you gradually lift-off from a grumpie menu ‚ôú-ie to a snappie menu ü•ß-lot.

<a href="https://youtu.be/U22VxoT-tNU"><img align="right" width="350px" src ="docs/pics/player.jpg" /></a>

Open _marking-menus_ of arbitrary depth via keyboard shortcuts. \
Transition seemlessly between the three different selection modes.

* üêÅ **Point-and-Click:** Select items by clicking them, or anywhere in the corresponding wedges.
* üî≤ **Marking-Mode:** Select items by drawing gestures. \
Leftclick anywhere and drag your mouse over an item to do so. \
Pausing or making a turn selects an item.
* üñ±Ô∏è **Turbo-Mode:** "Draw" gestures at any time while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, or <kbd>Alt</kbd>, _without having to press your mouse button_. (Especially useful having opened the menu with a shortcut involving one of these modifiers.) \
You can just keep it pressed and move the pointer with the mouse or your touchpad.

Set up menus and their appearance in a **live preview**. \
Compose your menus from _Run Command_ ‚û°Ô∏è _Activate Shortcut_ ‚û°Ô∏è _Insert Text_, or _Open File_. \
Several predefined menu types, such as _Bookmarks_, _Running Apps_, _Frequently Used Applications_, and _Pinned Applications_ are available.

A üöå **D-Bus Interface** can be used to open your configured menus or arbitrary menus defined with a JSON description. \
The selected item will be reported via a D-Bus signal.

Designed for you **if you have one hand at the mouse** or **touch input** most of the time.
It is _not_ designed to be used with a keyboard only; like for example [kupfer](https://github.com/kupferlauncher/kupfer)).
